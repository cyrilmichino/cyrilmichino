# Data Scientist, Tech Educator, Startup Operator
I'm a **data nerd building startups**. I founded [Zindua School](https://zinduaschool.com), a coding school upskilling young Africans into careers in tech i.e. Software Engineering and Data Science. Started off as the first technical mentor teaching and structuring the data program and have graudally grown into handling growth and day-to-day operations with the occasional monthly class. Also founded [Chaptr Global](https://chaptrglobal.com), a learn-now-pay-later service provider that works with tertiary educational  institutions to offer flexible financing options that improve access to such programs to lower-income Africans.

Beyond the fluff, I am a professional data scientist with a **background in Computer Science and Economics** from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en). I enjoy working with data regardless of the pipeline stage i.e. data analysis, machine learning & AI, and data engineering; however, my core strengths lie in machine learning. I enjoy teaching: I have championed courses and content creation in Machine Learning and Data Structures & Algorithms at Zindua School; I have some Udemy courses in Python Object-Oriented Programming, Dynamic Programming, and soon Machine Learning; and I write/build open tutorials on my YouTube channel and Substack publication.

Finally, and probably most importantly, this year I have started building for fun. Focus is on data apps and I'm realeasing something open-source every quarter. You can follow some of the top projects in my pipeline below. :point_down:
